## About

BI Xia 畢夏, is a PhD candidate in the [Public Design Lab](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/sd/research/research-centres-and-labs/public-design-lab/), [School of Design](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/sd/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/), supervised by [Prof. Kin Wai Michael Siu](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/sd/people/academic-staff/siu-michael/?sc_lang=en).

His PhD research, *SOLITARY INTERIORITY: RETHINKING POSITIVE SOLITUDE IN PUBLIC OPEN SPACE DESIGN WITHIN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN CONTEXTS* investigates how public open spaces in high-density cities function as sites for positive solitude, despite being primarily designed for social interaction. Grounded in relational thinking, Actor–Network Theory, and affordance-based perspectives, this research conceptualise these spaces as unplanned interiors and propose the notion of ***solitary interiority***.

Using a mixed research method—including behavioural mapping, on-site ethnographical interviews, and multisensory experiential observation-this research examine how individuals negotiate boundaries, atmospheres, and socio-material relations to create solitary interior experiences in public settings such as Hong Kong. 

BI Xia was a visiting scholar with the hosting professor, [Prof. Suzie Attiwill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzie-attiwill/), at [Interior Design](https://rmitinteriordesign.website/), [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in 2024, as a part of the PolyU PhD Research Student Attachment Programme and International Collaborative Research Fellowship. 

He received his Master of Arts in [Interior Design](https://interiordesignrca.co.uk/) from the School of Architecture, [Royal College of Art](https://2020.rca.ac.uk/students/xia-bi/), London (2018–2020). The degree project, [*Solitudism*](https://interiordesignrca.co.uk/student/bi-xia), developed his interests in solitude, interiority, interior behaviours and everyday practise spatial experience. 

He previously earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Product Design from the School of City Design, [Central Academy of Fine Arts](http://global.cafa.edu.cn/), Beijing (2013–2017). His final year project, [*The Corner*](https://www.behance.net/gallery/79059259/Interior-Behaviour-Design-Portfolio-Bi-Xia-), as a spatial interactive installation, explores the relationship between space, object and perception.
